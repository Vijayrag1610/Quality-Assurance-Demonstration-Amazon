# AmazonWorkDemo
I'm currently working as a QA Analyst in a MNC, for over 2 years. This is the basic demonstration of my adept in Automation Testing. Here I have used Amazon website, searched a product, opened the first search recommendation and captured a screenshot of product page and stored it in a folder. I have used POM design pattern for scalability.
